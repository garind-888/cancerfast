Dear Editor,



The intersection of cardiovascular disease and cancer represents a critical challenge in modern medicine. While previous studies have reported increased mortality in cancer patients experiencing acute myocardial infarction (1-3), the precise impact on cancer-specific survival and potential mechanisms remain undefined. We hypothesized that ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) significantly worsens cancer-specific survival and that diagnostic delays may contribute to poor outcomes.



We analyzed data from the EVALFAST registry, a prospective cohort of all STEMI patients managed through the Fribourg fast-track network since June 2008 (ethics approval: 001-R-CER-FR). Among 1,330 consecutive STEMI patients enrolled through November 2024, we identified 30 with active malignancy. For each cancer patient, we calculated relative survival ratio (RSR) as observed survival divided by expected cancer-specific survival based on Swiss population registry data matched by cancer type, stage, age, and sex (20% matched contemporary data, 80% historical estimates). Time intervals from first medical contact (FMC) to diagnosis, laboratory arrival, and balloon inflation were prospectively captured. We compared these intervals between cancer and non-cancer patients using generalized linear models, and tested whether mean RSR differed from 1.0 using one-sample t-test on log-transformed values (α=0.05, one-sided).



The EVALFAST registry included 1,330 STEMI patients, of whom 30 (2.3%) had active cancer. Among cancer patients (mean age 71.9±8.8 years, 76.7% male), predominant malignancies were lung (26.7%), prostate (20.0%), and renal cell carcinoma (10.0%). Most presented with advanced disease (stage III-IV: 56.7%). Median time from cancer diagnosis to STEMI was 148 days (IQR: 80-212 days). Twenty-three patients (76.7%) received chemotherapy, with anthracycline exposure in 6 (20.0%).



Using generalized linear models, we compared STEMI presentation times between cancer and non-cancer patients. Time from pain onset to first medical contact (FMC) was similar between groups (difference: -18.4 minutes, 95% CI: -69.7 to 32.8, p=0.48). However, FMC-to-diagnosis time was significantly prolonged in cancer patients (+11.3 minutes, 95% CI: 0.6-22.0, p=0.038). Total FMC-to-balloon time showed non-significant prolongation (+3.0 minutes, 95% CI: -1.5 to 7.6, p=0.19).



Mean relative survival ratio was 0.493 (95% CI: 0.174-0.427; p<0.001), indicating cancer patients experiencing STEMI achieved only 49.3% of expected cancer-specific survival. The survival distribution revealed alarming patterns: 50% demonstrated severely reduced survival (RSR<0.50), 30% moderately reduced survival (RSR 0.50-0.89), and merely 20% maintained near-expected survival (RSR≥0.90).



Subgroup analyses revealed marked heterogeneity by cancer type and stage. Lung cancer patients (n=8) had uniformly poor outcomes (mean RSR 42.6%), while prostate cancer (n=6) showed relatively preserved survival (87.8%). Renal cancer patients (n=3) experienced catastrophic outcomes (mean RSR 0.5%). A clear stage-dependent gradient emerged: stage I (86.4%), stage II (46.6%), stage III (74.0%), and stage IV (20.8%). Early-stage disease (I-II) had mean RSR of 69.5% versus 38.9% for advanced disease (III-IV).



Notably, survival reduction was consistent across cancer types and stages. Patients with matched contemporary registry data showed similar patterns to those with historical estimates (mean RSR: 0.447 versus 0.504, p=0.72). Bootstrap analysis confirmed robust findings with 95% CI: 17.4%-42.7%.



Our findings demonstrate that STEMI profoundly impacts cancer patient outcomes, effectively halving expected survival across diverse malignancy types and stages. This 50% reduction in expected survival represents a clinically meaningful effect size that exceeds the impact of many cancer progression events. The consistency across cancer types suggests STEMI triggers systemic pathophysiologic cascades detrimental to cancer outcomes, potentially including prothrombotic states, inflammatory activation, and treatment interruptions.



This study is unique in several aspects. While previous studies reported increased mortality in cancer patients with STEMI (1-3), ours is the first to quantify the relative survival ratio comparing observed to expected cancer-specific survival, demonstrating a precise 50% reduction. Additionally, we identified significant diagnostic delays (11.3-minute prolongation in FMC-to-diagnosis time, p=0.038) not previously reported, suggesting a potential mechanism for worse outcomes. Unlike prior registry studies focusing on in-hospital or cardiovascular mortality (1,2), we provide a comprehensive assessment of overall survival impact relative to cancer prognosis. Furthermore, 20% of our cohort had matched contemporary survival data, strengthening our findings.



These results have immediate clinical implications. First, they underscore the critical importance of aggressive cardiovascular risk modification in cancer patients, particularly those receiving cardiotoxic therapies. Second, they support enhanced cardio-oncology surveillance protocols for early detection of cardiovascular compromise. Third, they highlight the need for rapid revascularization strategies tailored to cancer patients' unique hemostatic profiles. The identified diagnostic delays warrant specific protocols to expedite STEMI recognition in cancer patients.



Study limitations include modest sample size, retrospective design, and reliance on historical survival estimates for most patients. However, the magnitude of effect and consistency across subgroups support our conclusions. The significant delay in STEMI diagnosis among cancer patients warrants further investigation, as diagnostic delays may contribute to worse outcomes. Future research should explore mechanisms underlying this dramatic survival reduction and evaluate whether cardioprotective strategies can mitigate these devastating outcomes.



In conclusion, STEMI represents a catastrophic event in cancer patients, halving expected survival regardless of malignancy characteristics. The observed diagnostic delays in cancer patients may contribute to these poor outcomes. These findings mandate integrated cardio-oncology care models prioritizing cardiovascular prevention, early recognition, and rapid intervention to preserve both cardiac function and cancer outcomes.
