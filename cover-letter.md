Manuscript submission - "ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction Halves Expected Survival in Cancer Patients Even After Effective Revascularization" 
:::

Dear Editor and Editorial Team,

We are pleased to submit our Research Letter entitled "ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction Halves Expected Survival in Cancer Patients Even After Effective Revascularization" for consideration for publication in JACC: CardioOncology.
Our study addresses an understudied question: what is the impact of STEMI on cancer-specific survival when patients receive guideline-directed primary PCI? Using the prospective EVALFAST registry (1,330 consecutive STEMI patients since 2008), we identified 30 patients with active malignancy who all underwent successful revascularization.

Our key findings reveal two concerning insights. First, we identified significant diagnostic delays, with cancer patients experiencing an 11.3-minute prolongation in FMC-to-diagnosis time compared to non-cancer patients (p=0.038), representing a potentially modifiable factor that may contribute to worse outcomes. Second, we found that survival was halved despite successful PCI, as cancer patients achieved only 49.3% of their expected cancer-specific survival even after effective revascularization (RSR 0.493, p<0.001). This dramatic reduction occurred across all cancer types and stages, suggesting that STEMI triggers irreversible pathophysiologic cascades that persist despite restoration of coronary flow.

These findings have immediate implications for cardio-oncology practice. The identified diagnostic delays warrant specific protocols to expedite STEMI recognition in cancer patients, while the persistent survival impact despite successful intervention underscores the need for enhanced preventive strategies in this vulnerable population.

This work has not been published elsewhere and is not under consideration by another journal. All authors have approved the manuscript and declare no conflicts of interest.

Thank you for considering our manuscript. We believe these findings will be of significant interest to your readership in understanding why cardiovascular events remain devastating in cancer patients even with optimal acute management.

Sincerly,
